<p>Diesel is a popular choice of fuel for larger, commercial generators. They can often take far more than what they are rated to handle and have been the staple of power protection for years. Let us start with the initial note as to what is lightning and why lightning protection is so important.

The modest expense of an emergency electrician is a small price to pay to keep your home and family safe. When you have a power outage, the generator automatically detects the problem and starts to provide backup power.</p>
