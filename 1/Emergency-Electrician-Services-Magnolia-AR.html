When a wire breaks, the electrical spark will arc - or jump - across the gap in order to complete the circuit. When fuses were used, homes didn't require that much electricity.

Our outdoor lighting specialists will design and install the landscape lighting that will give you all of the above benefits and make sure that your home remains up-to-code.</p>
