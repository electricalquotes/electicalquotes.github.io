In a typical household electrical circuit, the black circuit wires (and sometimes red) are the "hot" wires that carry power from the source to the switch or receptacle. For switches, you will need to first remove the switch and then touch the tester to the sides of all wires to ensure that none are live.</p>

Low voltage lighting requires a transformer to reduce the voltage to below 50 volts, most commonly 12 volts or 24 volts. Your home has different types of electrical circuits installed that serve different purposes.</p>
<p>It is more of a thinking process that is used to analyze a circuit's behavior and determine what component or components are responsible for the faulty operation.
