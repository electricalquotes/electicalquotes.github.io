They can run on a variety of fuel options, including propane and diesel, or even be hooked up to the municipal gas lines—that way, they run cleaner and don't emit the carbon monoxide fumes of portable generators. Although the process may be quick and the price of fuses relatively low, this home repair can be time consuming and irritating.</p>
<p>In the case of lightning, a power surge coming in through your power lines can overheat your equipment.
