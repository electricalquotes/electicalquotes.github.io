Fuses can only be used once; when a current is running at a level that's too high, the fuse will interrupt the electrical flow by melting.</p>
<p>Your transformer can be set to turn on and off based on time or even the level of sunlight, meaning it will turn on as the sun goes down at night and off as the sun comes up in the morning, a useful feature both for efficiency and security. Material: Most wire will be marked CU” for copper, the most common conductor of residential electricity. If you have never dealt with electrical installations, you should definitely consult with a professional.
