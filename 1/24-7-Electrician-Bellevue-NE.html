Let us start with the initial note as to what is lightning and why lightning protection is so important. Prior to restoring the primary voltage source, set the DMM to continuity mode (ohms) and verify at the motor starter line contactors that there is not a phase-to-phase short or a phase-to-ground short.</p>
<p>Enjoy the beauty of your landscape (and sure footing) after sunset with low voltage lighting. The transformer is what makes the system low voltage, as it takes the usual 120-volt house current and brings it down to 12 volts. The pre-packaged Protector Series backup generators run on diesel fuel, and are more cost-effective than many competitive diesel-fueled generators. Determine where and how you are going to use your landscape lighting kit before determining how many lumens you need.</p>
