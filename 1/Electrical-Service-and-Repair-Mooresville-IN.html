<p>Low voltage lighting systems were originally developed in the 1950's but have mostly been used for landscape lighting and some recessed and cabinetry lighting. Standby systems, as opposed to portable generators, are installed with a measure of permanence, meaning you don't need to store them and that maintenance is simpler. To be sure that lighting is the best it can be in your yard, it's important to do your research.
