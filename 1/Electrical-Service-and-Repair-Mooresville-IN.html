Our team at GAC Services can install, repair, and maintain a variety of home backup generators throughout Montgomery County There are several options to consider when deciding what type of home backup power system.</p>
<p>Low voltage lighting systems were originally developed in the 1950's but have mostly been used for landscape lighting and some recessed and cabinetry lighting. Standby systems, as opposed to portable generators, are installed with a measure of permanence, meaning you don't need to store them and that maintenance is simpler. To be sure that lighting is the best it can be in your yard, it's important to do your research. It must be plugged into a GFCI-protected outdoor electrical outlet fitted with a "while-in-use" cover, and oversize plastic box that closes over the power cord.</p>

However, homes not located on a gas service network use propane to fuel their standby generators. Generally, purchasing a good surge protector gives you the benefit of having lower electricity costs and better quality of your appliances.</p>
