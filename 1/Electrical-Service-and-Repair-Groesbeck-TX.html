Our in-house certified electricians are drilled and conversant with home, and commercial electrical rules and government accepted practices, they handle such intricate jobs.

If your current box doesn't have enough circuits to meet your household needs, putting in a new breaker panel is a practical solution. In these cases, it is the electricity company who is responsible for reconnecting power (Damaged power lines, for example, are an electricity company's responsibility).</p>
<p>However, self-installation and self-repair can be both dangerous and confusing. Because multiple devices (nodes) are connected, the ground potential at different nodes could be different, which can cause ground currents to flow through "the path of least resistance" via either the common earth ground or the ground wire. The modest expense of an emergency electrician is a small price to pay to keep your home and family safe. When you have a power outage, the generator automatically detects the problem and starts to provide backup power.</p>
<p>Look in the fuse box or breaker box and see what rating the fuse is set at, look on the outer sheathing on the wire and see what its rating is. If you are continually resetting breakers or replacing fuses then there is likely to be a fault and more current is trying to be drawn than the circuit is designed for.
