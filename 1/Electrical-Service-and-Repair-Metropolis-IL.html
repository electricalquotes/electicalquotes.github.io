<p>10. A dangerous condition where an individual could make an electrical contact with an energized equipment or a conductor which the person may sustain injury from it. There are many different types of electrical outlets, some of which are required for specific appliances. Transformers or power-packs are designed to plug into any 120vac house circuit and reduces the output voltage to 12vac which creates a low-voltage system. If your breaker box isn't functioning properly, it's very likely your home's appliances won't function properly either.</p>

<p>The voltage reading at the hub must reflect the same reading for all lights in the group. Since your breaker panel is essentially the nervous system of your home, it's important to keep up with the maintenance and ensure that everything is working properly. But understanding the basics of your home electrical wiring doesn't have to be so intensive.
