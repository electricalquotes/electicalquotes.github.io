<p>A plus for running propane over NG is that you will get the full 20KW out of the genset rather than a 20% reduction (e.g. 18KW) using NG. I think that is one of the reasons why Generac came out with the 22KW unit, even though it uses the same two cylinder engine in order to pump up the NG output. Breakers Won't Remain Reset: If you notice that a reset circuit breaker in your electrical panel won't stay reset or restore power, then it's very likely that you have a faulty service panel.</p>
