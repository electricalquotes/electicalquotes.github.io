Putting customers first is always our main priority here at electrical services from the time you pick up the phone and speak to our helpful, polite office staff, until the time we complete the task in hand. Most professional quality LED installations can use a series or "daisy chain" method.</p>
<p>After you have determined which wire is the hot power wire, be sure to turn the electricity back off at the breaker box. Its premium power quality makes it possible to light up the house within 10 seconds of a power outage. As noted above, there are two possibilities for the incoming power: either in the switch box or in the outlet box. With factory certified technicians of many home and commercial generator brands, we can provide any necessary work your generator needs regardless of whether or not you purchased the system from us. Quality service is our priority.</p>
