Faster response - When utility power fails, KOHLER generators restore power to your home three times faster than competitive models. Here's some vital information to help ensure your safety around utility poles and power lines. But the low-voltage wiring on the low voltage secondary wiring that is operated by wall switches and used to control 120V devices may itself be un fused.</p>

If the current panel in your Knoxville home has been in place before you moved in 20 years ago, it might be time for an upgrade.

On an ungrounded electrical circuit you should install only two-prong, ungrounded receptacles - that is code compliant and that also lets users know that there is no reliable electrical ground present.
