The use of 12 or 10-gauge main cable increases efficiency and allows you to either place greater loads on your home runs or to use a lower voltage tap, in effect giving you the ability to increase voltage to existing fixtures in the future or to add more fixtures to that run without having to install a new home run cable. When a surge protective device senses a transient voltage spike, it uses internal components called Metal Oxide Varistors (MOVs) that act like magnets for the excess voltage, and sends it to the load center's ground wire before it can reach your home's connected electronics.</p>
<p>If the breakers in your older home trip often, it could mean that your modern appliances are too powerful for the electrical system, or there's faulty wiring.

If you are the type to use many electronics in your home then you are aware of the energy needed to run all that equipment and the inconvenience of having to unplug all of them when they are not being used.</p>

The hot wire and the switched wire are connected with that tab, making both wires hot all the time, whether in that outlet or another on the same switch.
