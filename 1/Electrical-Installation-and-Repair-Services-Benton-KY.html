If it still doesn't light you have an electrical problem and this should be referred to your local mechanic. You might need to update your breaker box, add a subpanel, or upgrade some of your electrical wiring. Limited Residential Electrician - You must have completed an approved apprenticeship program in Oregon or you must have 288 hours of classroom training and 4,000 hours of on-the-job training or experience, or you must have 8,000 hours of experience from outside Oregon.</p>

<p>All that is necessary there is to either replace the outlet OR to jumper the bottom half onto the top half and cap off the switched wire, leaving it unused in the box. With the outlet, I used a receptacle that allows for side wiring (traditional), or back-wiring (not back-stab, but where there's a plate under the screw that clamps down on the wires). Do check that there aren't some bare wires nutted together, with no insulation on them at all, though - those would be ground.</p>
