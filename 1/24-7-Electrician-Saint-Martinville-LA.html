When purchasing a power cord, consider the electrical load it will carry. The hot source at the outlet is spliced to the black wire running to the switch and the hot wires running to the other outlets in the circuit. And whether the journeyman electrician candidate has acquired the desired skills, knowledge, and electrician training necessary to become a certified or licensed electrician.</p>
