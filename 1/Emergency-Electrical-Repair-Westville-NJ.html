<p>It seems like just about everyone reaches a point in their life when they want to be a landlord. Using the recent fault tracking devices, our electricians can rapidly repair faults. The reason why many homes built in that period may have aluminum wiring is that the U.S. was going through some severe copper shortage at the time.

<p>Journeyman Election: Completion of an approved residential apprenticeship program. That might sound obvious but the freedom of movement that portable generators offer is truly a wonderful thing.

The adopted rule removes the restriction on the number of hours of on-the-job experience an applicant for any electrical license may earn within a given year.

Eco-conscious choices like CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lightbulbs) and outdoor lights cost more and can run as high as $200 per light.
