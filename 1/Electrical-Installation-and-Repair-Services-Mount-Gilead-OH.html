Electrical repairs should always be done by a licensed and insured electrician. These range from small single outlet surge protectors to new age shapes and designs to fit in odd spaces.

<p>Purchasing a transformer with a higher maximum wattage capacity will come in handy if you want to add more lights later. The higher watt bulbs of the 120 volt systems are problematic in the fact that they create unwanted glare and reduces your ability to create subtle landscape lighting effects and much more expensive to operate moreover flexibility low voltage fixtures can be moved to different location easily VS high voltage needs j-boxes & wiring to work.</p>
<p>IN choosing these devices, one must remember not to confuse a surge protection strip with an ordinary power strip. These whole house generators are designed to run for longer times using either liquid propane or natural gas. Just use a small electrical device like a drill and check each receptacle using the chosen device. Contact us today for a free landscape lighting consultation by completing the web form to the right.
