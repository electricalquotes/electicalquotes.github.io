<p>Spikes can degrade wiring insulation and destroy electronic devices like battery chargers, modems and TVs. Plus they run on natural gas or propane, which means they can operate for days or weeks on a full whole-house propane tank, or indefinitely in the case of natural-gas versions.

Generally, purchasing a good surge protector gives you the benefit of having lower electricity costs and better quality of your appliances.</p>
<p>Do not carry or lift up electrical equipment by the power cord. Here you will find important information, documents, and addresses relating to low voltage power distribution and electrical installation technology.

<p>Circuit breakers are designed to trip or cut-off power to the circuit when more amps are being drawn than the wire is rated to carry. Consider the power savings of LED bulbs to save money over time. You want to replace a half hot outlet with a switch (dimmer) to run some LED lights. Cutting through cables, drilling into wiring in the walls and trying to effect a repair while the appliance is still plugged in are just some of the causes of fatal electric shocks that occur each year in homes.</p>
