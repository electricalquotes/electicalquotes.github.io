<p>If your electrical usage is expected to go up significantly, you will need to do this upgrade. Our skilled electricians will hang your ceiling fan on your existing preinstalled fan box, or install new wiring, switches and a fan-rated brace box for any area of your home. If that's the case, you'll only have one black wire, one white wire, and a ground wire connected to the outlet. It's imperative that the size of the wires you choose matches the amperage of the circuit.</p>
<p>A full electrical wiring inspection is the only way to know for sure where the problem originates. If your lights come with press-on fittings—the type that bite through the insulation and into the landscape lighting wire to make their connection—cut them off and use the wire connectors shown in Photo 4.

Turn the power back on. As you progress in replacing bigger and more complicated fixtures you may want to try installing a new fixture where one did not exist.
