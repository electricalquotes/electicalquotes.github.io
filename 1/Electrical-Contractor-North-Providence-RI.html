Check with the lighting manufacturer to determine the proper-size cable to use for your specific system.</p>

This measures the property's use of electricity, in a unit of measurement called a kilowatt hour (kWh).

And an added benefit is that many include a back-wire” feature, not to be confused with cheap stab-in” connections, which we don't recommend using for wiring a light switch.</p>

Most homes on the city grid often use natural gas to power space heating and other appliances, including backup generators.
