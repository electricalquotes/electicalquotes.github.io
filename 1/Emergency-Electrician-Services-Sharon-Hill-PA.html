Firstfirm: Suggest you pull the switch from the wall and look at the wires there. To familiarize with troubleshooting methods for both motors and drives following methodologies that have been developed by manufacturers in order to reduce downturn time dramatically. In today's energy-dependent world, it's a lot more than just an inconvenience: Electrical outages can stop you dead in your tracks.</p>
<p>On this one, it tests, correctly, with a plug-in AC tester, when the outlet is just connected, but, not yet inserted into the enclosure box. They generally take several hundred hours of classroom instruction and are contracted to follow apprenticeship standards for a period of between three and six years, during which time they are paid as a percentage of the Journeyman's pay.

They have a defective design that allows power to flow even when the breakers are switched off. Note the colors of the electrical wires that attach at the terminal screws for the switch.</p>
<p>If that is the case, the switch leg of the circuit, from the switch to the outlet, may be white, and the yellow wire spliced to it in order not to have a white wire on the brass screws. On the other hand the FPE breaker does not turn power off by "tripping", allowing the circuit wiring to reach a combustible temperature which ignites the wires, outlet, and surrounding area.
