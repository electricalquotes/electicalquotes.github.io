<p>Specifically these are hard wired lights, not merely lamps plugged into outlets. Even if you take all the above electrical safety precautions, it's still a good idea to have the right protection in the case of a fire.

People who splice wires by twisting the ends together and covering the result with electrical tape face a higher risk of encountering a problem in the future.</p>
<p>If the breakers in your older home trip often, it could mean that your modern appliances are too powerful for the electrical system, or there's faulty wiring.
