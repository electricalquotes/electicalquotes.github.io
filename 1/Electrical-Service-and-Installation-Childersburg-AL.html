<h3>Tips For Safe Use Of Electricity Childersburg AL 35044</h3>

Never touch the bus bar inside an electrical service panel unless the main breaker has been turned off or the main fuse removed. One of the dangers of PVC wiring is that if there are a lot of wires confined in a small area, this may lead the wires to overheat.</p>

High voltage power may be run to a central driver location ideally, within 50 feet of wire length from lighting, depending on the system and wire types), and then all wiring downstream of the drivers may be Class 2. Class 2 wiring does not need to be inside a conduit or junction box, nor does it need to be grounded.</p>
