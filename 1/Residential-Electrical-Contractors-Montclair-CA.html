Wind storms, ice accumulations and heavy snows may reduce the normal space between energized electrical lines and the ground. Portable generators must be kept outside in a dry area, never inside the home or any enclosed or partially-enclosed spaces such as your basement, garage, or crawl space because of the carbon monoxide (CO) emitted while the generator is running, electrocution and fire risks.</p>

When you call Mr. Electric, we will inspect around your electrical panels if you have an older home and provide fuse box upgrades in Roswell if you need it.
