<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician Contractor in Muncie</h2>

<p>If you've forgotten which two black were hooked to the same timer wire you may have to play with them, changing configurations, to get what you want, but in any case it sounds like two black wires should be joined together and go to one switch terminal and the third black goes to the other switch terminal. Use power boards with in-built safety devices to avoid a power outlet overload.

When you call Mr. Electric, we will inspect around your electrical panels if you have an older home and provide fuse box upgrades in Roswell if you need it.
