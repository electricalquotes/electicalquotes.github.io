<p>Diesel generators are also time tested and have, over the years, also proven them to be very effective and reliable in generating electricity in times of power outages. In the event of an unprecedented occurrence such as a severe thunderstorm or hurricane, electricity is often the first thing to go. When you invest in a whole home generator, you are protecting your home against power surges and blackouts that would otherwise leave you powerless. Another common belief is that if an individual circuit breaker pops or a fuse blows on a regular basis, the service requires upgrading.</p>

<p>A full electrical wiring inspection is the only way to know for sure where the problem originates.
