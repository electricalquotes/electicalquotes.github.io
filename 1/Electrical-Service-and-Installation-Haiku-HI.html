<p>Specifically these are hard wired lights, not merely lamps plugged into outlets. Even if you take all the above electrical safety precautions, it's still a good idea to have the right protection in the case of a fire. Here's what to look for when shopping for a surge protector, and how to use it safely once you bring it home. People who splice wires by twisting the ends together and covering the result with electrical tape face a higher risk of encountering a problem in the future.</p>

<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings. Capabilities exist to modernize and extend the life of the active components, i.e., circuit breakers, while leaving the existing switchgear structure intact.</p>
