Never use extension cords under rugs or carpet, near high-traffic areas, wrapped around table or chair legs, through doorways or anywhere they can be pinched, flattened or severed. This is a new area for the Building Regulations and is called Part P (electrical safety). If you don't need to provide GFCI protection for other devices, or if the receptacle is at the end of the circuit (end-of-run), use only the LINE terminals, following the manufacturer's wiring diagram.</p>
<p>When you upgrade to a 200 AMP breaker panel, though, you can ensure that your electrical panel box is not only able to handle the power demands of your home but is also much safer. For maximum light output and fixture life, the goal when installing low voltage systems is to provide each lamp with between 10.5 and 11.5 volts.

Your new generator will have a fuel source connected directly to the generator and if it is natural gas, there is nothing to refill as it is delivered to your Bay Area home consistantly.</p>
<p>Don't get overloaded when using extension cords. Circuit breakers trip to stop the flow of energy when too much is being supplied.
