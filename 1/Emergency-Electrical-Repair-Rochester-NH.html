I will be upgrading the electrical panel in my home from 100 to 200 amps. In older homes, outdated electrical work may not be up to code, and today's greater electrical needs can result in overloaded circuits. The best solution is to have a standby generator system installed.</p>
<p>Journeymen electricians have completed several years of on-the-job training and acquired the appropriate license in their state. Other outlets cannot be on the same circuit.
