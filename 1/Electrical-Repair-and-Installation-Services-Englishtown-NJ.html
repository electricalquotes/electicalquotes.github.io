<p>When you have a generator installed, it will be able to detect the power outage and will kick into gear to keep the power running. It is very important to purchase the correct transformer for your lighting system. The investigation looked only into the wire connections at the outlets. The wrong type of electrical wiring was used to power the lights.‚Äù Rather than the wiring specified by the manufacturer of the LED lights, communications wiring that is used for items including voice, data and audio transfers was employed.</p>
