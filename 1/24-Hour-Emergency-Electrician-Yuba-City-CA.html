Optical isolation uses an LED (Light Emitting Device) and a photosensitive transistor to transfer data across the isolation barrier - typically an air gap; in other words, data is transmitted using light instead of electrical signals, so there is no physical connections between the grounds and the data lines, thus removing the ground loop problems and effectively preventing electrical surges and spikes from destroying other parts of the system.</p>
<p>A circuit breaker panel is not exactly the same as the fuse box because it has mechanical, toggle-switch circuit breakers, not fuses, but it does perform the same function. When you need to find a lighting repair service in your area that you can count on, remember Mr. Electric. A standby generator is viewed as an appliance that reduces the chance that you will submit an insurance claim because it can prevent damages from occurring when the power is out (like frozen pipes or basement flood damage).</p>
