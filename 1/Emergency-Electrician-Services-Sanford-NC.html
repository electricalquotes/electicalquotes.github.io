<p>Common emergency repairs we see consist of GFI ground fault issues, breaker repairs after a lightning storm and outlet repairs due to circuit problems. When the electricity arcs (jumps, or "arcs") from an exposed energized conductor or circuit part (e.g., overhead power lines) through a gas (such as air) to a person who is grounded (that would provide an alternative route to the ground for the electrical current).
