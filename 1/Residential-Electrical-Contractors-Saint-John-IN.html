<p>A plus for running propane over NG is that you will get the full 20KW out of the genset rather than a 20% reduction (e.g. 18KW) using NG.

Breakers Won't Remain Reset: If you notice that a reset circuit breaker in your electrical panel won't stay reset or restore power, then it's very likely that you have a faulty service panel.</p>
<p>Installation is simple; just use the real metal stake to install each light into the ground in the perfect location. And if more than 15 amps flows through the circuit, the breaker trips. The transfer switch automatically starts the generator, which powers the circuits in the subpanel.
