However, they require slightly different wiring than a single switch and are a bit more expensive to replace.

<p>Interest in low voltage, or 12v, lighting has grown in our increasingly energy-conscious customers over the last several years, with the emergence and proliferation of long-life, energy-efficient lighting. I sprung for a $100 700W generator a few years ago, maybe another hundred bucks worth of parts, quality gas cans, and a propane camp stove. Make all connections at the fixtures using silicon filled wire connectors, stripping back the insulation a minimum of 1 inch.</p>
<p>2. If you need to remove the wires from the lighting fixture and reconnect it to the connector, then please insert the wires into the bottom of the jack through its center, making sure that the metal needles in the jack penetrate the wire insulation to reach the conductor.
