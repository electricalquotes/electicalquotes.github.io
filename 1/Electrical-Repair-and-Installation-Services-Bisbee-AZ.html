<p>EC&M ranks the biggest electrical contracting companies of the year. Once you're sure that power is shut off to the wire that will be fed into the old-work box, insert the old-work box into the drywall opening with the power wire running through the drywall opening and fed through the old-work box with at least six to seven inches of the wire exposed (you can use a wire stripper to strip the wire ). Secure the old-work box to the drywall with screws, wire and mount your new light switch into the old work box, and then secure it to the wall with screws.</p>

<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings.

<p>Using surge protectors extends the life of appliances and electronics by as much as 30%. Alternative power generation, such as solar and wind, is an emerging field that should require more electricians for installation. We are happy to answer any questions you may have, and can also schedule a convenient time for you to meet a highly trained, experienced electrician in your area.
