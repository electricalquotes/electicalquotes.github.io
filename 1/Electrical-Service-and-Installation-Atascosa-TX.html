<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings. Capabilities exist to modernize and extend the life of the active components, i.e., circuit breakers, while leaving the existing switchgear structure intact.</p>
<p>However, the electrician also needs to know beforehand exactly which switch is directly linked to the specific light fixture to be replaced. Its diminutive structure, however, does not mean that its surge protection capabilities have been compromised. Simply plug a Switcheroo into your switched outlet, and then another Switcheroo into as many outlets that you want to turn on and off with your existing switch. Some older homes will have electrical panels that are not suited to handle the electrical demands of modern homes.</p>
