Enter the backup generator: your personal solution for short-term energy independence, making home life livable until your electrical service can be restored.</p>
<p>After all, your light switches don't belong in your pocket. You want people driving by to take a second look because what you've created is interesting,” says Chris Mitchell of landscape lighting firm NiteLiters in Owensboro, Ky. To avoid disruption of your day and unplanned downtime, we recommend having your generator checked regularly by trained professionals like those at Innovet Electrical & Heating and Cooling. Avoid placing power cords close to electric devices that emit heat.</p>
<p>Storms and severe weather have always posed a threat to our electrical systems, but infrastructure is beginning to age. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, then you'll want to look for fixtures labeled: "hard-wire" or "direct-wire", and unless your kitchen is already set up for these fixtures, you will need an electrician to install new wiring and a switch or dimmer to control the lights. If you live in an older home or if your house doesn't have proper wiring, it can cause a power surge.</p>
