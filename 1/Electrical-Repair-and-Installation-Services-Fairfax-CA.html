Residential electricity as an industry is fairly young; electrical systems have only been a standard installation in new homes since about 1930. Sometimes homeowners choose to upgrade service while doing another project, such as burying an overhead power line.</p>
<p>Low voltage lighting still has to be plugged into a power outlet in order to function, even though the voltage level is very low and relatively safe. For example, to install a breaker is the same skill and method in both the Residential Maintenance electrician job and the Industrial Maintenance electrician job.

<p>In addition to adding beauty to your home and accentuating its features, outdoor lighting is also an essential security element.
