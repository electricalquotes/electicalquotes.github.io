These indoor units are manufactured with secondary input connections that are compatible with wiring methods from NEC chapter 3, such as those that include Â½ inch knockouts or NM cable clamp, permitting compliance with 411.4. Section 411.4 states that low-voltage lighting systems must not be concealed or the wiring must not extend through a building wall, unless using a wiring method specified in chapter 3. The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>

<p>A power surge, which is also called transient voltage, is basically an increase in voltage that's above the normal level of electricity flow. While a surge will not necessarily severely damage or destroy a piece of equipment right on the spot, it can peck on it for a very long time and eventually cause problems serious enough for you to notice. These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>
<p>This clean power will not create fluctuation in electric power which occurs through traditional generators. After power returns, the generator shuts itself off and will turn back on should there ever be a power outage again. It automatically starts within seconds of detecting power loss, and runs on the home's existing natural gas or LP fuel supply. They know how to install top-quality lights correctly, so there are no unfortunate issues down the road that can cost you more in the long run.</p>
