Low-voltage lighting is versatile because you can mix any fixture types you want along the same transformer line, from patio wall lights to walkway lights. During a power outage, run a cord from the backup generator to the inlet, flip a manual transfer switch on the subpanel, and all the designated circuits will have power.

<p>Going back to the standards and regulations, it should also be noted that there has been considerable change to the rules surrounding electrical installation. Disconnect the other cable so boxes farther from breaker are disconnected from the circuit. Other common outdoor path lights include low profile edge, well, or flood lights. Surge protectors are an effective guard for electric devices, against spikes.

<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings.
