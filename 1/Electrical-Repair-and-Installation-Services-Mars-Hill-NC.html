<p>The aluminum stranded wiring you see on the 220 volt appliance and air conditioning circuits do not pose a problem. Backup generators work on a just in case” basis. Single lights may not provide all the lighting you need. Connect all the fixtures and use a graph paper for calculation of the total length of wire that you need, which would be restricted to a maximum of 250W on a length of 12 gauge cable.

Some electrical work is fine to DIY, but a licensed electrician should do big jobs like replacing an electrical panel. Your home is outfitted with hundreds of lighting fixtures designed to provide light and comfort when it's dark. Most people that aren't familiar with construction or electrical wiring, or even old electrical wiring, aren't going to have an idea, what these wires are.</p>
