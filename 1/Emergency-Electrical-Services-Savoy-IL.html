<p>2. If you need to remove the wires from the lighting fixture and reconnect it to the connector, then please insert the wires into the bottom of the jack through its center, making sure that the metal needles in the jack penetrate the wire insulation to reach the conductor.

You'll then connect the bare copper ground wire to the green screw.</p>
<p>The aluminum stranded wiring you see on the 220 volt appliance and air conditioning circuits do not pose a problem. Backup generators work on a just in case” basis. Single lights may not provide all the lighting you need.

Conditions exist in any transmission and distribution system that result in power losses in the systems and equipment that deliver power and in the systems and equipment that use power. To remove the defective switch, disconnect the two wires from the terminals by loosening the screws in a counter-clockwise direction. Be sure to tighten all wire nuts or terminal screws firmly and give each wire a tug test as you connect them.</p>

The ceramic is designed to protect the plug (or other equipment inside which the fuse is fitted) from heat and fire when a high current flows. Another reason you may want to upgrade is if you find yourself constantly needing breaker panel repairs.
