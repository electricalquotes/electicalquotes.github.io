<h3>Standby Generator Benefits Stoughton WI 53589</h3>
<p>When you have an electrical problem turn to TLC for fast, reliable service you can count on. Your panel is also known as your fuse box, fuse panel, or circuit breaker panel, and is designed to trip and shut off when too much current flows through one particular circuit. A standby generator, or automatic standby generator , is a type of system that turns on whenever you lose power, rather than waiting for you to hit the switch.
