<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Augusta</h2>
<p>Importance of hiring a certified and licensed electrician.

<p>PLEASE turn OFF the power at the fuse box or circuit breaker before you begin installation. If you notice that the switch seems to be reversed i.e. the switch indicates ‘on' but the light is off and if the switch indicates ‘off' but the light is on, then you have incorrectly wired the switch and it will have to be redone properly.
