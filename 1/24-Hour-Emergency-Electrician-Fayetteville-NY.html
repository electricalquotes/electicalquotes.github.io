You can buy adapters that piggyback on your existing electrical wiring to transfer data - and they're easy for homeowners to install without the assistance of an electrician. Ensure cords are in good condition - if they're worn or frayed, don't use the appliance until it's been repaired by a licensed electrician.</p>
