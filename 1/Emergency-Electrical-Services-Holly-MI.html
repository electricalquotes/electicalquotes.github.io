<p>The neutral hole is connected to the wire that brings the electrical current back to the breaker box. 6. Perform continuity and resistance checks on relay coils and contacts, overloads, fuses, circuit breakers, switches and other control circuit components. The first electrical codes in the United States originated in New York in 1881 to regulate installations of electric lighting. There is going to come a time when your property's electrical system isn't functioning like it should be, and when that time comes, no matter how minor the issue at hand might see, the best thing you can do is to call in a professional Birmingham electrician as quickly as possible to get to the bottom of the issue.</p>
<p>All that is necessary there is to either replace the outlet OR to jumper the bottom half onto the top half and cap off the switched wire, leaving it unused in the box. With the outlet, I used a receptacle that allows for side wiring (traditional), or back-wiring (not back-stab, but where there's a plate under the screw that clamps down on the wires). Do check that there aren't some bare wires nutted together, with no insulation on them at all, though - those would be ground.</p>
