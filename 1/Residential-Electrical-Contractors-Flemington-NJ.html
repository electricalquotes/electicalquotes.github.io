<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings. Capabilities exist to modernize and extend the life of the active components, i.e., circuit breakers, while leaving the existing switchgear structure intact.</p>
<p>Much care is taken so that established root systems, trees , shrubs and plants are not damaged during lighting system installation. Certificate programs may focus solely on residential electrician work, while associate's degree programs are broader and usually require some general education courses as well. However, a good general rule is that the final installed cost is usually twice the price of the generator.
