<p>This popular tester is also used by most inspectors to test for power and check the polarity of circuit wiring. Sometimes, power interruptions could be out of faulty electrical wiring or any disturbances in the power lines, from the generators to the complex system of transformers and outlets. Besides being hazardous, having tangled cables and wires can make it harder to be productive. As a consequence, circuit breakers are slow acting, and often will not trip with a slight trickle of power to ground.</p>
