	<meta name="description" content="Electrical Panel Repair & Replacement  Edgewater New Jersey - As defined by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) , a ''relay'' is "a device that is operated by a variation in the conditions of one electric circuit to affect the operation of other devices in the same or another electric circuit." A ''contactor'', on the other hand, is "a device for repeatedly establishing and interrupting an electric power circuit." It is important to recognize the difference between the two, noting particularly that the relay, serving a secondary role, causes other devices to function, whereas the contactor is the primary unit, doing its work in the main power circuit.">

<h3>Best Whole House Generator Reviews Edgewater NJ 07020</h3>
<p>Most electric power is generated and consumed in the form of alternating current (AC), and most meters that measure energy consumption are designed to measure AC power. Upgrade the electrical wiring in your home to the latest acceptable standards if you have an older home or if your electrical needs outstrip your current demands. Components connected in parallel are connected so the same voltage is applied to each component. Natural disasters can wreak havoc on complex wiring systems, and it is emergencies like these where a homeowner or a business owner will need the assistance of a licensed electrician.</p>
