A surge protector or surge suppressor is an appliance or device designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes. If there is you can check to verify that it is hot all the time and that it is on the same circuit (turn the breaker off and see if both it and the red go dead). If you've noticed that the electrical outlets in your home aren't working as well as they use to, or they aren't able to hold the plug, it may be time to repair or replace it. Having malfunctioning outlets can be a serious shock and fire hazard.</p>
<p>LEDs are rated to last for a very long time, meaning you won't have to change out your landscape lights every summer. Keeping outlet load at a reasonable level is one of the electrical safety tips that can save lives.
