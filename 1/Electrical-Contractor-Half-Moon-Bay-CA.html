Our convenient kits are easy to install, giving homeowners the opportunity to show off their lighting design talents. The technician may check the voltage of the unit's electrical components and tighten connections. In most states, you only need a high school Diploma to apply for an apprentice license, and you don't need any electrical training to qualify for it. Once you receive your apprentice license, you can apply for an apprenticeship under a licensed electrician.</p>
<p>Unscrew these screws then remove the plates covering each switch. This course is designed to familiarize participants with the use of basic troubleshooting procedures to troubleshoot problems in electrical circuits. Unplug unused appliances and stow cords safely out of reach of pets, young children or hazardous situations. Turn the power back on at the circuit breaker. Getting your electrical panel inspected and repaired as soon as possible will keep your family connected and safe.</p>

Tip: If there are two switches mounted side by side in the junction box or two switches on one unit, be sure that the circuit governing both switches are turned off.</p>
