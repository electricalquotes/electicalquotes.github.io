<h2>How To Hire Certified Electrician in King George</h2>
<p>You may at some time experience an electrical shock when entering or exiting your RV. This is often caused by the wiring in the electrical receptacle that your RV is plugged into or an improperly wired extension cord. Click the Generac logo below to learn more about the Generators we carry.

Larger generators, such as home standbys, are rated by kilowatt (kW), which measures the generator's electrical power output.
