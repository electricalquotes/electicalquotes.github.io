I will be upgrading the electrical panel in my home from 100 to 200 amps. In older homes, outdated electrical work may not be up to code, and today's greater electrical needs can result in overloaded circuits. The best solution is to have a standby generator system installed.</p>
<p>The Power Meter: The power meter, sometimes referred to as the energy meter, or electricity reader, is either located on the electrical panel itself, or somewhere near it. This measures the property's use of electricity, in a unit of measurement called a kilowatt hour (kWh).
