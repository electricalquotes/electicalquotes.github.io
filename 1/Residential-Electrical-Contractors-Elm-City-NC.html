Check with the lighting manufacturer to determine the proper-size cable to use for your specific system.</p>
<p>While a spa, hot tub, or sauna sounds like a delightfully hedonistic addition to your home, all these luxury accessories involve both water and electricity, which means that improper installations can lead to disastrous results. Even in states that do not have contractor licensing requirements, financial incentive programs often include installer requirements, such as pre-approval or, some cases, NABCEP certification.
