<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Emporia</h2>
<p>Are the circuit breakers in your home constantly tripping? Electrical switches, timers, outlets, lights etc are never wired in series. Electricity is a tremendous force moving at the speed of light that we generate and control in wires and equipment. All of our trained electrical contractor professionals are committed to delivering the same standards of quality to residential customers throughout all of our service areas.

Attach the positive wire from the transformer to the low-voltage light's positive wire and the neutral wire to the the light's neutral with twist-on wire connectors.
