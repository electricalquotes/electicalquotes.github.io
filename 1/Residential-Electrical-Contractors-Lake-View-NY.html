<p>Whether you want to highlight a few features of your landscape or enhance the entire area, you can achieve your goals with landscape lighting. Some generators are certified to be kept as close as 18 inches from your house. Leave the wire loose as we will be encircling each fixture with a small loop of cable before burying it. Use 14 gauge wire for jobs totaling less than two hundred watts, and 12 gauge cable for systems that exceed 200 watts.

A GFCI outlet is an extremely sensitive outlet that monitors the current passing through it. If there's a slight change in current coming back from the equipment plugged into the outlet, the GFCI will automatically disconnect the circuit so the electrical current is no longer flowing.
