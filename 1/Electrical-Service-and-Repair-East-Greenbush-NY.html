Tip: Don't bury the cable more than 3 inches or you'll have difficulty connecting the light fixture.</p>
<p>You can change the look of the lighting simply by changing the lens that is used on the light fixture. Having a certified, licensed electrical contractor can determine if you need to upgrade.
