<p>Do have any problems with your receptacles and switches. Automatic Power on Standby: When utility power fails, it comes as a shock to realize how much we rely on technology and others to provide simple requirements like air conditioning and lighting Now you can always have a reserve power supply that can fill the void left by utility power failure.
