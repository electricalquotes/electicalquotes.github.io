The number, color, and function of the wires at an outlet can be confusing if the original connections are lost track of.

<h3>Residential Electrician Serving Greeneville TN 37743</h3>
<p>It is important to plan ahead when installing low voltage lighting so that you can avoid any potential problems, especially with the setup. Tell children that electric cords should be left alone. Portable generators employ propane or gas tanks. Installing a home generator is not as easy as simply plugging it in. In fact, the installation process can be quite complex. The worst time to try installing a portable generator for the first time is in the dark after your power has already gone out.</p>
<p>Anytime you work with electricity, it can be very dangerous and only a qualified electrician should install this equipment.
