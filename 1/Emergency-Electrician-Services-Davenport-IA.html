Upgrade the electrical wiring in your home to the latest acceptable standards if you have an older home or if your electrical needs outstrip your current demands. Components connected in parallel are connected so the same voltage is applied to each component. Natural disasters can wreak havoc on complex wiring systems, and it is emergencies like these where a homeowner or a business owner will need the assistance of a licensed electrician.</p>

Let your landscape lighting illuminate every occasion and invite people into your home safely and beautifully by highlighting walkways, architectural elements, gathering spaces, water features and more.

<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings. Capabilities exist to modernize and extend the life of the active components, i.e., circuit breakers, while leaving the existing switchgear structure intact.</p>
