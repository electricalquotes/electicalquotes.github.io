The path for current flow on each set of contacts is through the movable contacts to the common terminal. Adding landscaping lights to your garden or yard can make quite an impression.

Before doing any work on the switch, the power source must be turned off by set­ting a circuit breaker to OFF or removing a fuse. Provide branch circuit overcurrent protection for each contactor or starter in accordance with the National Electric Code® and local electrical codes.</p>
<p>How much power you want in your generator depends on how many items in your home you want to run at the same time during a power outage.
