<p>A circuit breaker trip helps to stop the flow of electricity. A good rule of thumb is that if you upgrade your panel (the electrical service into your house) you should upgrade your wiring. When the main disconnect fuses also need to be changed, along with much of the existing system, this cost can climb even higher. Having a generator on hand lends peace of mind in case of a weather emergency or other power interruption. Feel confident that AEC emergency electrical service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assist you with all your emergency electrical needs.</p>

The boxes have labels to tell you what color wires go into each hole. Either unplug some items or call an electrician to discuss your increased electrical needs.

Certificate programs may focus solely on residential electrician work, while associate's degree programs are broader and usually require some general education courses as well.
