Not all rubber insulated copper wire is plated, but if you suspect that the silvery-colored wire is plated copper, it's easy enough to determine: with the wire disconnected from any power source, scratch the silver colored surface of the rubber-insulated wire and you'll see its red copper interior. If you go a long period without needing your portable backup generator, you may spend a lot of money on gasoline you cannot use.</p>
<p>If it is, though, you can make any or all of the outlets half hots. We will review your unique situation and offer you an honest estimate on an electrical service upgrade that we guarantee will be completed on schedule. Outlets that have moisture in them may create a shock hazard. If your devices are hit with a power surge, the excess power could easily burn them out, rendering them useless.
