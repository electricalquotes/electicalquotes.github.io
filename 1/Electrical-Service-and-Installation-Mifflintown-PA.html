<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician in Mifflintown</h2>
<p>Our licensed, professional electricians service commercial properties all across Central Texas, whether it's changing light bulbs or addressing a location's entire electrical service. Generally speaking, though, being an electrician doesn't come with any major risks to your long-term physical health (excluding the potential for electrical shocks, which you can read about here ). In many ways, a relatively active job like electrical work is preferable to a job that has you parked in front of a computer all day - the dangers of sitting down for long periods of time are well-documented , and this isn't something you'll have to worry about too often when you're working as an electrician, zipping from one job to the next all day long.</p>

The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent of the regulated voltage, when the generator is carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate.</p>
