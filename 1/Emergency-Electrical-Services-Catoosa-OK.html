<p>You might be considering repainting interior rooms or completing some other small remodeling projects over the winter months.

Also, don't touch electrical equipment, including light switches and power cords, with wet or damp hands. This will be the biggest switch on the electrical panel, and will often be in the form of two switches fused together. For more than a century, Westinghouse has consistently provided innovative, reliable, high-quality products and customer service.</p>
