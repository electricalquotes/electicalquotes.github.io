Our convenient kits are easy to install, giving homeowners the opportunity to show off their lighting design talents. The technician may check the voltage of the unit's electrical components and tighten connections. In most states, you only need a high school Diploma to apply for an apprentice license, and you don't need any electrical training to qualify for it. Once you receive your apprentice license, you can apply for an apprenticeship under a licensed electrician.</p>
