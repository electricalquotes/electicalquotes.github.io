It allows for reasonably sized conductors (in other word the wires) to conduct electricity without significant voltage drop. This will help you avoid voltage drop, which occurs when not enough current reaches the lights at the end of a run, McGowan says. LED and other low voltage lights come in a huge variety of styles and are perfect for creating soft and elegant mood lighting.</p>

On an ungrounded electrical circuit you should install only two-prong, ungrounded receptacles - that is code compliant and that also lets users know that there is no reliable electrical ground present.
