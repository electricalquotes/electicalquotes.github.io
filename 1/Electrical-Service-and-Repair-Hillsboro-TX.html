The system is said to be very effective in terms of providing light to exterior and even garden fixtures that serve to advance the beauty as well as the mood projected of the house. In general, if your home is more than 30 years old, you'll want to have a licensed electrician look at your electrical system to ensure it's safe and code-compliant.</p>
<p>You can then put the old outlet off to the side and you'll be left with five wires: two black wires, two white wires, and one ground wire. The Briggs & Stratton generator is fitted with a 200-amp automatic transfer switch and computer-controlled load management power switching. A home's breaker box is central to the electrical system.
