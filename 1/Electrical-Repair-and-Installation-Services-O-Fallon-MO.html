Some stranded aluminum wiring is still used in houses today for the main service entry wires and other 240 volt circuits like ranges and clothes dryers. Every generator has a fuel source that it's powered by. Unless you are using a wind generator, you will most likely have to store fuel in preparation for power outages. Tip: Don't bury the cable more than 3 inches or you'll have difficulty connecting the light fixture.</p>
