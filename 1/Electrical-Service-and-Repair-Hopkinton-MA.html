Not only do fuse boxes create additional safety concerns, but they could be a reason that home insurance companies refuse to cover your home (or pay out if you do get coverage). When issues arise with your generator, it is best to rely on a licensed electrician who has an in-depth knowledge of these systems. A typical low-voltage system reduces your 120-volt residential electricity to 12 or 24 volts.</p>
<p>If the box already exists, installing a new outlet should be pretty easy and not require new wiring.

For homes larger than 3,500 to 4,000 square feet, you may even need two breaker panels, a 200 Amp one and an additional 100 to 200 Amp panel to supplement it. Obviously then, the larger the number, the greater the amount of protection the device can offer.</p>
