<p>Electricians often need to move around all day while running wire and connecting fixtures to the wire. Don't go for house generators that huge power output because it won't be of much use. Many states also require a qualifying score on an examination to ensure knowledge of local regulations and the National Electrical Code. Unlike diesel generators there is more maintenance involved in these. I'd give serious consideration to hiring an electrician that will allow you to do lots of the mundane work like nailing up the boxes, running the cables between them, and even allowing you to connect up many of the switches and outlets after the drywall is up. But allow the electrician to do all of the truly complex aspects that only come with years of experience.</p>
<p>If the breakers in your older home trip often, it could mean that your modern appliances are too powerful for the electrical system, or there's faulty wiring. If there are two brass screws for the black wire, and a breakable tab between them, it might be possible. Your final step is to turn on the transformer to ensure that the lights work. If you are the type to use many electronics in your home then you are aware of the energy needed to run all that equipment and the inconvenience of having to unplug all of them when they are not being used.</p>
