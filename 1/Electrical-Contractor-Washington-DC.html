<p>So if you are replacing an older, existing switched outlet, and if it has 2-wire cable between the outlet and the switch, then the white wire is being used as either a permanent hot or as the switched power and IS NOT neutral. If your current line can hold 150-amps, you might want to consider that if your budget cannot handle nearly $5,000 for the upgrade to 200-amp service. The licensed electricians of MB Heating & Cooling help you determine the right size generator that is capable of powering you through a utility outage.</p>
<p>After you have determined which wire is the hot power wire, be sure to turn the electricity back off at the breaker box. Its premium power quality makes it possible to light up the house within 10 seconds of a power outage. As noted above, there are two possibilities for the incoming power: either in the switch box or in the outlet box.
