Lighting not only represents the image of your company, but it enhances business and minimizes liability when in peak operating condition.

<p>The new electrical panels do come with trip switches that simply cuts off the power when there is an overload. With our monthly lighting inspection, the Alameda Electric team works in partnership with your team to represent your property in the best possible way. Whether you've just bought a new home, are tired of dealing with faulty electricity, or have gotten a notice from the city, our electricians at Fox & Sons can help bring your breaker panel up to code quickly and affordably.</p>

<p>3. Garden Lighting - having a garden at home enhances the beauty of the place even more.

That's why a recent, first-of-its-kind study from the Fire Protection Research Foundation carefully examined electrical risks and hazards present in older homes.</p>
