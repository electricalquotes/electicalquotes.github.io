<p>Click Add a reminder” (right-hand margin) to request notification when it's time to renew your electrical contractor's license. This license shall be issued to those engaged in contracting to install, alter, repair, renovate or add to electrical wiring, appliances or apparatus for the purpose of electrical light, heat, power or signal systems or other similar purposes within or affixed to any building or structure, and who possess a valid State of Colorado Master Electrician License.</p>

We will review your unique situation and offer you an honest estimate on an electrical service upgrade that we guarantee will be completed on schedule. Outlets that have moisture in them may create a shock hazard. If your devices are hit with a power surge, the excess power could easily burn them out, rendering them useless.
