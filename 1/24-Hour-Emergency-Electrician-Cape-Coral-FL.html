When you hire a qualified electrician for an electrical inspection, they will test the circuits that run to the outlets and switches for signs of damage. If you've noticed that the wires inside of your walls are fraying, it's definitely time to replace them. There was the ground, white and black as normal but the second screw for black has 2 wires and the back of he outlet had an additional white and black in the respective holes in the back of the outlet.</p>
