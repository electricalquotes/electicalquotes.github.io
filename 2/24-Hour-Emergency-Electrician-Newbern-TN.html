The main component for distributing safe voltage to all landscaping lights is the transformer. With our knack for design using quality LED lighting, we take pride in the fact that our customers trust us to design and create a beautiful nighttime effect for their house, landscape, or property that will enhance curb appeal and increase security.

<p>3. Garden Lighting - having a garden at home enhances the beauty of the place even more. Improperly sized overload elements of any of the several types available could cause unnecessary tripping of the contactor and shutdown of the motor if the elements are undersized.

Since the transformer is already plugged in, the fixture should light up. If it doesn't, pull apart the connector and try again, or check the lightbulb.
