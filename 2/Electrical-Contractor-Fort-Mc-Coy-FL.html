Now that you know what types of generators are available, talk with a professional to help you decide whether a standby or portable one is right for you.</p>
<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings. Capabilities exist to modernize and extend the life of the active components, i.e., circuit breakers, while leaving the existing switchgear structure intact.</p>
