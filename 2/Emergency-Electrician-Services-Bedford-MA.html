Air-cooled generators are smaller and less costly, but they're also louder than liquid-cooled models, even though liquid-cooled generators are typically larger. This wiring is now required in most switch boxes as of 2011. An effective preventive electrical maintenance program involves scheduling routine inspections and checkups on a regular basis, ensuring that your equipment and machinery is continually checked for both minor and major problems.</p>

Although many electricians are trained in 4-5 year apprenticeship programs, formal certificate and associate's degree programs are also available for aspiring residential electricians. Either way, you will need what is called "3-wire cable" (black, red, white, and green OR metal all sheathed together: yes I know that makes 4 wires, but that's what it's called!) to connect the two boxes.</p>
<p>In case a situation arises, like a hurricane or other type of powerful storm, you'll be glad you had Guin Service install your generator because you know the job was done correctly the first time. Most homes will have a few outdoor electrical sockets, but if you have one that is too far away from your light fixtures, you may need to call in a professional electrician to wire one closer for you.
