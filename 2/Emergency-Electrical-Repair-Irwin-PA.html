An authorized Honeywell Generators dealer will discuss your home backup power needs with you so that they can recommend the best standby power system. An APC surge protector is superior to the protective devices manufactured by its competitors for several reasons.</p>

Large appliances like refrigerators, stoves, window air conditioners, washers and dryers should never be plugged in with extension cords or power strips. Either remember this in your head or mark the wires with electrical tape.</p>
<p>Outdoor lighting installation offers several benefits. Plug heat generating appliances directly into an outlet, not into a power strip or extension cord.

Another reason you may want to upgrade is if you find yourself constantly needing breaker panel repairs.
