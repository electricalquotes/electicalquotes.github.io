<p>In most cases, solar is a specialty classification under the general electrical or plumbing licenses and all appropriately licensed contractors can install solar systems without the solar specialty license. The operation of DC motors is based on the same principles as is the operation of AC motors. In this article series we list common old building electrical wiring system safety concerns and we illustrate types of old electrical wires and devices. This diagram shows the wiring for multiple switched outlets on one switch.</p>

The boxes have labels to tell you what color wires go into each hole. Either unplug some items or call an electrician to discuss your increased electrical needs.
