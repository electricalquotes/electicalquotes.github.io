<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician Service in Waller</h2>
<p>When your business depends on electrical machinery and equipment for increased productivity and improved cash flow, it is extremely important to keep that machinery inspected and well-maintained on a regular basis.

The white wire is commonly used as the LINE down to the switch and must be re-indentified with a different color to indicate that. Or you could remove the wires from the switch and tie those two together, bypassing the switch.
