Outweigh the risks of such a specialised electrical job and don't try to fix the problem yourself. Ground wires are bare copper wires. Manufacturing and production facilities have power needs that are far different from the general needs encountered in other avenues of the electrical profession.

Another common belief is that if an individual circuit breaker pops or a fuse blows on a regular basis, the service requires upgrading.</p>
