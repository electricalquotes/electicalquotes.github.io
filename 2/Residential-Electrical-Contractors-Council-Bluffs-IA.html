And power outages can threaten the very lives of those who depend on electrically powered medical equipment to stay alive and well.

If there is voltage, and the switch is operating properly check the water pump wiring for an inline fuse. Important Note: We can only perform service and maintenance on generators that we install. Pull the outlet and wires out from the wall enough that you have space to work.</p>

Our licensed, certified and insured electricians are always available to help restore the safety and reliability of your electrical system.
