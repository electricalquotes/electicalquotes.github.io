<p>To stay within a 0.5 to 1.0 volt differential between the first light and the last fixture on a given circuit, you must group the fixtures into distance zones and not overload the cable with excessive wattage. I will be upgrading the electrical panel in my home from 100 to 200 amps. In older homes, outdated electrical work may not be up to code, and today's greater electrical needs can result in overloaded circuits. The best solution is to have a standby generator system installed.</p>

Cutting through cables, drilling into wiring in the walls and trying to effect a repair while the appliance is still plugged in are just some of the causes of fatal electric shocks that occur each year in homes.</p>
