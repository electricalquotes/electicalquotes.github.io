Here's what electrical cable looks like inside. Oftentimes, the light problem isn't from the light fixture itself, but from the light switch. Circuit breakers are contained within your electrical panel and their job is to protect the electrical circuits in your home or building by stopping the flow of electricity in the event of an overload, short-circuit, or other electrical fault.</p>
<p>Old main panels have limitations on available space to add circuits or they have fuses (some insurance carriers will not insure a property that has fuses).

If there is you can check to verify that it is hot all the time and that it is on the same circuit (turn the breaker off and see if both it and the red go dead). If you've noticed that the electrical outlets in your home aren't working as well as they use to, or they aren't able to hold the plug, it may be time to repair or replace it. Having malfunctioning outlets can be a serious shock and fire hazard.</p>
<p>Landscape lighting design is very similar to the design of the landscape itself.
