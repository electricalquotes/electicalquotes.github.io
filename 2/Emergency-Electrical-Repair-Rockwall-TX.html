<p>A panel box upgrade is safer and gives your family more options with electrical devices and appliances. You can substitute up to 1,000 hours of experience for graduating from a two-year program at an approved electrical school. Our in-house certified electricians are drilled and conversant with home, and commercial electrical rules and government accepted practices, they handle such intricate jobs.
