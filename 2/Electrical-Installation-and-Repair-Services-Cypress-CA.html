After completing this course, participants should be able to describe hazards associated with faults and overloads, describe the operation and common types of circuit breakers and fuses, and describe basic procedures for troubleshooting problems with circuit breakers and fuses. Your electrical services provider will know all the safety precautions they need to take and can even identify potential problems before they take hold.</p>
<p>Spotting minor problems during a service check will save you expensive repairs later and insure your generator will work when you NEED it to work. The lighting in your home or business does more than just allow you to see, it is an integral part of the atmosphere you want to have.

Determine the function of the outdoor lights that you are planning to buy. Take a look at these Honeywell Automatic Home Backup Generators to provide backup power for everyday life.

<p>Circuit breakers are designed to trip or cut-off power to the circuit when more amps are being drawn than the wire is rated to carry. Consider the power savings of LED bulbs to save money over time. You want to replace a half hot outlet with a switch (dimmer) to run some LED lights. Cutting through cables, drilling into wiring in the walls and trying to effect a repair while the appliance is still plugged in are just some of the causes of fatal electric shocks that occur each year in homes.</p>
