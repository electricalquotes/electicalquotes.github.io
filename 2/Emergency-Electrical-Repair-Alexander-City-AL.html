<p>The Limited Residential Electrician apprenticeship program is a 2 year program designed to give students the experience and training necessary to become licensed limited residential electricians. Code § SPS 305.40 , the electrical wiring activities that may be undertaken by a person who holds a license or registration as a licensed Residential Master Electrician, a licensed Residential Journeyman Electrician or a registered Residential Electrical Apprentice shall be limited to wiring associated with dwellings, dwelling units and detached accessory buildings and structures serving the dwellings or the dwelling units, such as garages, carports, gazebos, and swimming pools.</p>
<p>The Standard for Low Voltage Landscape Lighting Systems, UL 1838, covers the safety requirements for landscape lighting systems; the Standard for Low Voltage Lighting Systems, UL 2108, covers incandescent luminaires and luminaire fittings; and the Standard for Low Voltage Lighting Systems for Use in Recreational Vehicles, UL 234, covers luminaires for recreational vehicles.

Electrical emergencies can be disruptive to your home and business. Programmable timer switches allow you to have more control over when and how your lights turn on and off. The amount would also be much lower if the homeowner does the installation, as you need not allocate an extra amount for the technician who will install the wiring.</p>
