<p>A lot of us keep a generator around for those occasions where some extra power might be warranted, but a home standby generator isn't just a little piece for handling a couple of extra rooms. Never place surge protectors or their power supply cords under a rug or someplace they could experience wear and tear from being stepped on. And don't staple or tack their power cords to anything. Fuses can only be used once; when a current is running at a level that's too high, the fuse will interrupt the electrical flow by melting.</p>
<p>When an electrical panel needs to be replaced, upgrading the service should also be considered. Professional generator installation is the best way to avoid this issue. Before you replace the fuse, be sure to turn off all electrical appliances on its circuit, particularly those that you suspect may have caused the fuse to blow. Permanent home standby generators are also considered as automatic systems. This article also covers lighting equipment connected to a Class 2 power source.</p>
