<p>A: When contracting with the public and requesting permits, your business must be licensed as an electrical contractor.

Electrical and fire safety officials warn that one misconnected wire can be deadly. Generac standby systems run an average $1,900 for a 7kW unit. Master - If you have not completed an approved apprenticeship program, you must show proof of six years of full-time experience supervised by a licensed master electrician.</p>

The next step is to take precautions to ensure that you are as safe as possible when in your home or when working with electricity. Some of the initial system checks could include making sure that the unit controls and equipment are properly functioning. If you make the mistake of hiring an electrician who specializes in just residential electrical work or is not familiar with all the various codes and regulations, then you could be facing huge liability issues if someone gets hurt.</p>
