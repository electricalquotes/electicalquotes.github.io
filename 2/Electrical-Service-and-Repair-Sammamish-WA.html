<h3>How An Electrician's Home Energy Audit Can Save You Money Sammamish WA 98074</h3>
<p>There is one aspect of electrical panel replacement that few people ever consider, and that's the immense savings you can receive. Old electric panels contain fuses, which can have problems. Because modern homes us a number of energy-hungry appliances, a 200-amp panel is the minimum we'd suggest. We use that information to determine if you need a panel change or an entire service upgrade. Sydney Electrical Service was really there for me when my kitchen power went out, luckily they were able to respond very fast and send out an Emergency Electrician within the hour.</p>

<p>Fuse Box Replacement vs Upgrade - If you have a fuse box, whether or not it is acting up, we strongly recommend an upgrade. The braided fabric wire insulation was found on a 1960's fluorescent light ballast, while the plastic wire was used in the branch circuit wiring for the light where that ballast was employed.
