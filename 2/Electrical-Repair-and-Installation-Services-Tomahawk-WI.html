One of the first questions I ask a potential client is why they want to upgrade their panel or service. Electricity has made our lives more enjoyable in so many ways- but that doesn't mean it comes without its risks-we'll walk you through some electrical safety tips that all homeowners should be aware of.

Physical size of the old electrical panel may be too small to preclude its re-use with a panel retrofit kit, so the entire box needs to be replaced.</p>

Find Landscape Lighting Transformers with a photocell or timer to effectively utilize your system. Use adequately sized extension cords when using a portable generator. Anything over this amount is considered transient and can damage electronic devices that are plugged into an outlet.</p>

<p>Using this method of twisting the wires together is the best practice for outdoor lighting, or any wire connection for that matter, it's even better then soldering the wires together because the flux in the solder will corrode the wires over time causing a poor connection or high resistance in the wires. Fitted to the Generac 7033 standby generator is a 200-amp NEMA 3 whole-house smart transfer switch that is rated for both in- and outdoor usage. The free end of one wire will connect to the green ground screw of the outlet, and the other free end is to be connected to the metal box with a green screw (expressly for that purpose) or other approved means (special clips, etc).</p>
