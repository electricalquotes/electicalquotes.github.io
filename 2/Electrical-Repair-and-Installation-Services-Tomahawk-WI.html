One of the first questions I ask a potential client is why they want to upgrade their panel or service. Electricity has made our lives more enjoyable in so many ways- but that doesn't mean it comes without its risks-we'll walk you through some electrical safety tips that all homeowners should be aware of. Our trained and experienced electricians have the appropriate tools and expertise to repair and install LED recessed lights with ease and precision. Physical size of the old electrical panel may be too small to preclude its re-use with a panel retrofit kit, so the entire box needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>Homeowners can stay safe by following municipal guidelines that require new swimming pools to be installed by licensed professionals, and by ensuring that any power sources near the pool be GFCI outlets to minimize the risk of electric shock. Find Landscape Lighting Transformers with a photocell or timer to effectively utilize your system. Use adequately sized extension cords when using a portable generator. Anything over this amount is considered transient and can damage electronic devices that are plugged into an outlet.</p>
<p>LED retrofit bulbs can be used in some fixtures as an energy-efficient replacement for MR-16 halogen lamps.

<p>Using this method of twisting the wires together is the best practice for outdoor lighting, or any wire connection for that matter, it's even better then soldering the wires together because the flux in the solder will corrode the wires over time causing a poor connection or high resistance in the wires. Fitted to the Generac 7033 standby generator is a 200-amp NEMA 3 whole-house smart transfer switch that is rated for both in- and outdoor usage. The free end of one wire will connect to the green ground screw of the outlet, and the other free end is to be connected to the metal box with a green screw (expressly for that purpose) or other approved means (special clips, etc).</p>
