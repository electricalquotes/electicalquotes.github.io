Moreover, sufficient egress lighting must be installed at exit accesses, exits, and exit discharges. So no matter what size covers you need to use - tall, deep, jumbo, narrow, short - your switches will always fit the openings and screw holes on your wall plates.

It's imperative that the size of the wires you choose matches the amperage of the circuit.</p>
