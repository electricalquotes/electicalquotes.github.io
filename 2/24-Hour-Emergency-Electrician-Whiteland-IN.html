Every day, all around the world, people depend on technology, transportation, energy and infrastructure to live, work and thrive. Although some people might want to switch to a circuit breaker, the financial cost of doing so may be far too high, especially since fuses and circuits are not completely identical in all electrical applications. You purchased a standby generator because you needed power no matter what the conditions are.</p>
<p>If you hear crackling, sizzling, or buzzing noises coming from outlets, switches, or appliances , you could have a serious problem.

Your home is divided into various electrical zones, each of which has a circuit particular to your electrical needs in that area.
