Landscape lighting is a great deterrent to thieves who thrive under the cover of darkness. Also, replace any frayed power cords on electrical appliances you use. Your electrical panel trips all the time. Whole House power supply can power a house up to 12,000 square feet with two 5 ton air conditioners or an electric oven and smaller home appliances. Whole house generators allow even very large homes with high power use to keep things running smoothly no matter what happens to the public power grid.</p>
<p>Federal Pacific circuit breaker panels, with their faulty Stab-Lok breakers, still lurk in many older homes, says Volpe who replaces at least 300 each year.

Additionally, 9% of product-related electrocutions each year are caused by accidents involving lawn or garden equipment and ladders, which come into contact with overhead power lines.</p>
