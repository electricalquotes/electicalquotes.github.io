<p>Follow the rules above for extension cords and triple taps, and apply common sense to your electrical needs overall. Reliability means you can be sure that the installed electrical systems will continue to perform for a long period of time and as they were designed.

<p>If your home is more than 20 years old, has constant problems with flickering lights or tripped breakers, or constant electrical failures, chances are it needs a service upgrade.

<p>A circuit breaker panel is not exactly the same as the fuse box because it has mechanical, toggle-switch circuit breakers, not fuses, but it does perform the same function. When you need to find a lighting repair service in your area that you can count on, remember Mr. Electric. A standby generator is viewed as an appliance that reduces the chance that you will submit an insurance claim because it can prevent damages from occurring when the power is out (like frozen pipes or basement flood damage).</p>

The farther your lights are from this transformer, the dimmer they are going to be.
