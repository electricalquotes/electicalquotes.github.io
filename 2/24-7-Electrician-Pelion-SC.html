<p>A circuit breaker trip helps to stop the flow of electricity. A good rule of thumb is that if you upgrade your panel (the electrical service into your house) you should upgrade your wiring. When the main disconnect fuses also need to be changed, along with much of the existing system, this cost can climb even higher. Having a generator on hand lends peace of mind in case of a weather emergency or other power interruption. Feel confident that AEC emergency electrical service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assist you with all your emergency electrical needs.</p>

If you're noticing minor rust on your breaker panel's housing, have it inspected by an electrician. Electrical problems are among the leading causes of home fires in the United States alone.</p>
