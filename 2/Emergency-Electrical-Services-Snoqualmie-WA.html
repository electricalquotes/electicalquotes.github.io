I have not tried the drilling machine trick yet, but will doing so most likely before the weekend - I can say that this trick sounds totally logical and correct as when I was still at school and studied Electrical Technology and Auto Electrical principals, we were taught to use a battery, but as I don't have a low current battery ( torch batteries ) on hand without going to buy them specifically for this one time use ( our school always had 6 Volt or 9 Volt lantern batteries on hand for the hands-on class ( referring back to the early 1980's ), I cannot use a standard car battery as the amount of amps the car battery can supply through the low resistance stator coils will burn the stator of rotor coils out instantly.</p>

<p>We hope this buyer's guide for backup generators will assist you as you choose a generator for your home. Wired systems typically comprise three main components: a power pack, lamps and a cable.
