<p>Computers and other electronics need to be protected by a surge-protector and it can help to keep them safe and avoid any damage. Most programs provide everything you need to work in residential settings, but to become a commercial electrician or to work in a specialty area you may need additional training and licensing.

Accent, path, or task lights can be used around the home with different levels of light in a variety of different designs. We make sure that your outdoor lighting system is good as new, by conducting frequent outdoor lighting inspections and repairs, and by making sure that fixtures and glass lenses are clean.</p>
<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>

Like accent lighting, they are able to give you a great control over what areas are lit, and are able to add lighting to a room without overpowering it. Because they are designed to be a continuous sequence of lights, they can also be a great choice to light a large rooms well.
