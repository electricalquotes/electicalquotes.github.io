The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent of the regulated voltage, when the generator is carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate.</p>
<p>Cables are color coded to tell you about the size of the wires inside the cable. Might be switched, but not only half of it. A power check will also tell you if power is making it to the switch.
