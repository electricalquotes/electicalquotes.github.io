Secure the old-work box to the drywall with screws, wire and mount your new light switch into the old work box, and then secure it to the wall with screws.</p>

<p>Some in-ground fixtures come with covers, leaf-guards or gravel screens. You can use the existing wires, but be aware that after a long time, the wires will be stiff and coated in dirt. That's why hiring a residential electrician is important in keeping you safe and making sure your electrical repairs are done to code. Some homeowners want the generator installed in a garage since there is already a concrete floor and the unit will be out of the weather and safe from thieves.</p>
<p>With 25 years of experience servicing our New Jersey customers, we can repair just about any generator, so if yours needs a professional touch to keep it running during the most crucial times, let us know. If your current box doesn't have enough circuits to meet your household needs, putting in a new breaker panel is a practical solution.

In a typical household electrical circuit, the black circuit wires (and sometimes red) are the "hot" wires that carry power from the source to the switch or receptacle. For switches, you will need to first remove the switch and then touch the tester to the sides of all wires to ensure that none are live.</p>
<h3>Importance of Using a Beattyville KY Licensed Electrician</h3>
<p>Circuit breakers often require less maintenance than a fuse box and they are easy to reset if they are triggered. At Hoffman Electrical, our team of fully certified, licensed electricians offers quality, professional, and friendly electrical service and can help you keep your home or building powered safely.

If you live in an older home or if your house doesn't have proper wiring, it can cause a power surge.</p>
