<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Pooler</h2>
<p>You might be considering repainting interior rooms or completing some other small remodeling projects over the winter months. Home centers carry a limited selection of portable generators (but usually no standby units). Stick with one voltage - 120 volts AC. Also, don't touch electrical equipment, including light switches and power cords, with wet or damp hands. This will be the biggest switch on the electrical panel, and will often be in the form of two switches fused together.
