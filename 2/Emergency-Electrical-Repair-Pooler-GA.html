<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Pooler</h2>
<p>You might be considering repainting interior rooms or completing some other small remodeling projects over the winter months. Home centers carry a limited selection of portable generators (but usually no standby units). Stick with one voltage - 120 volts AC. Also, don't touch electrical equipment, including light switches and power cords, with wet or damp hands.
