Fortunately, with the help of an electrician, you can add 220-volt service to your home, or run more 220 circuits if you need to add extra outlets. Electrical Trade students at Fortis are instructed in the professional skills and knowledge they'll need to enter the workforce as residential, commercial or industrial electricians, trained in safe work habits as well as OSHA and National Electric Code compliance standards.</p>

Homeowners whose houses still use fuse box panels may want to upgrade to breakers.</p>
<p>Standby generators connect to your home's fuel supply (natural gas or propane). At the outlet box, if there are cables other than the new 3-wire you are using to connect the outlet to the switch, splice them together by color: Black wires together, white wires together, and all ground wires (including the one in the 3-wire cable) together, all with like-colored pigtails. The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules. NRTLs such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Edison Testing Laboratories (ETL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) test appliances to ensure they comply with OSHA's electrical safety rules.</p>
