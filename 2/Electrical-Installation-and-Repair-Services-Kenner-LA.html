This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
