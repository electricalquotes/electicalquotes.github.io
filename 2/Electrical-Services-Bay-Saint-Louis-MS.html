Because they are designed to be a continuous sequence of lights, they can also be a great choice to light a large rooms well.

<p>Because low voltage lighting systems operate on only 12 volts of electricity, they are completely safe for self installation. When a wire breaks, the electrical spark will arc - or jump - across the gap in order to complete the circuit. When fuses were used, homes didn't require that much electricity.
