<p>Because these lights lay nearly flush to the ground, they create an entirely different look than the other lights we considered. In other words, if you find yourself constantly tripping your circuit breakers when one appliance is plugged in or turned on, chances are you need to upgrade the circuitry. LED lighting is also a great choice because it is much less expensive than traditional incandescent lighting (saves as much as 50% on power usage) and can last much longer as well.</p>

<p>One way to do this is by teaching them about safety around electricity in your own home. Contact a licensed electrical contractor if you have flickering lights, sparks, non-functioning outlets, or need wiring repairs or upgrades.

You'll then connect the bare copper ground wire to the green screw.</p>
<p>Flood lights and spotlights are the most adaptable form of outdoor lighting. Wear sturdy, rubber-soled shoes when working with electrical appliances outdoors.
