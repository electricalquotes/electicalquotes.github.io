<p>Your electrical panel is the unit that provides current throughout your home. Regular maintenance ensures your generator will never fail to operate as issues such as broken parts, electric malfunctions, and wear and tear as a result of age and usage, can be identified and fixed before they become a problem. LED bulbs can last up to 30 years, where standard bulbs need to be replaced every year or so. Furthermore, because LED fixtures are smaller, they allow for lighting designs which previously may have been impossible due to the limitations of standard systems.</p>
<p>The electrical panel is the heart of your electrical system. Instead, they hook up directly to your home's existing fuel line - whether it be natural gas or a form of liquid petroleum. To add a receptacle you need a proper hot, neutral and ground wire. When shopping for a standby generator, it is best to go through a certified generator dealer to ensure that a generator transfer switch is properly installed by a licensed electrician prior to generator installation.</p>

Another common belief is that if an individual circuit breaker pops or a fuse blows on a regular basis, the service requires upgrading.</p>
