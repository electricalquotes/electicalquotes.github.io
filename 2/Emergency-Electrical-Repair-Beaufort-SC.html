Unscrew the switch from the electrical box and pull it out with the wires still attached. These two components work together to maintain constant electrical power for a home or business when there is an outage.</p>
<p>Our plumbers, electricians, and HVAC technicians are some of the highest trained professionals in the industry. The proliferation of wireless handheld devices that charge at lower voltages make surge protection more important than ever.
