These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>
<p>Diesel generators are also time tested and have, over the years, also proven them to be very effective and reliable in generating electricity in times of power outages. In the event of an unprecedented occurrence such as a severe thunderstorm or hurricane, electricity is often the first thing to go.
