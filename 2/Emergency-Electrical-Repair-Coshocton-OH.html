<p>If you calculate a number higher than your current service panel, an upgrade is in order. This is the amount of current that is allowed to pass through to electronic devices after the damaging currents have been diverted into the ground. If your appliances aren't running at full capacity, it may be a result of a faulty electrical panel.

Many surge protectors come with USB connections, so you can charge your mobile devices without having to use a their wall warts. By updating the panel and getting experienced advice on the state of your wiring, you can rest assured that your home's electrical system is safe.
