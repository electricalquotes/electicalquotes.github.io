Or you could remove the wires from the switch and tie those two together, bypassing the switch. Refueling-If your generator runs on gas, this step won't apply to you because the gas is sourced from an outside pipe.</p>

When purchasing a power cord, consider the electrical load it will carry. The hot source at the outlet is spliced to the black wire running to the switch and the hot wires running to the other outlets in the circuit. And whether the journeyman electrician candidate has acquired the desired skills, knowledge, and electrician training necessary to become a certified or licensed electrician.</p>

This wiring diagram shows electrical power entering the ceiling light electrical box and then continues to a wall switch using a 3 conductor cable.
