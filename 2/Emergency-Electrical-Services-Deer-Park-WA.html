At NY Landscape Lighting, we want to improve your life through the design, installation, and service of outdoor LED lighting. Home generators are a backup power source for your home that will automatically turn on in seconds following any power outage or power service interruption, keeping the lights on, the water hot, the HVACⓇ or heat on, your electronics charged and operational, keeping your lines of communication open, and your home safe and secure for your family and your property.</p>

Do not use light duty extension cords in a non-residential situation. Air-cooled generators are smaller and less costly, but they're also louder than liquid-cooled models, even though liquid-cooled generators are typically larger. This wiring is now required in most switch boxes as of 2011.

A joule rating of at least 600 should be able to handle most household surges. Important note: NEVER increase the size of a panel breaker on a circuit that keeps tripping. When looking at the green screw of the receptacle terminal, it should be connected to a metal box or electrical box.</p>
<p>Carry an apprentice license for 8000 hours, pass the Journeyman test and hold that license for another 4000 hours and then pass the master license.
