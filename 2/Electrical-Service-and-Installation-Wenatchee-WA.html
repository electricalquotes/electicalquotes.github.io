<h2>How To Hire Certified Electrician Service in Wenatchee</h2>
<p>An electrician refers to a person who specializes in equipment that are associated with electrical wirings of structures and buildings.

Again, the ground wire always gets connected to the green screw, no matter the wiring scenario. In a typical household electrical circuit, the black circuit wires (and sometimes red) are the "hot" wires that carry power from the source to the switch or receptacle. For switches, you will need to first remove the switch and then touch the tester to the sides of all wires to ensure that none are live.</p>
