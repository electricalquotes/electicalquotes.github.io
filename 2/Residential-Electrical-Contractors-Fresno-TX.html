It is strongly recommended that you consult a professional before attempting any lighting or wiring projects.

Knob & tube wiring does not provide a third wire for grounding and is therefore considered unsafe in kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms and outdoors.</p>

Do the same with the black wires. Even if you are not noticing any signs of failure or overload, but you know that your electrical panel is a few decades old, it may be time to replace it. On average, it has a service life of 25-40 years. An electrical contractor is different from an electrician; an electrician is an individual tradesman and an electrical contractor is a business person or company that employs electricians.</p>
<p>Electricians are licensed for up to 5 years. Journeyman License: An applicant needs to complete a specialized training program or have 4 years of supervised working experience.
