South Dakota Codified Law (SDCL) 20:44:14:01(12) defines an "owner's exemption" as an exemption from licensure requirements for an individual owner who is personally installing electrical wiring and fixtures in a residence or farmstead which is owned and resided in or on by the person installing the electrical wiring or fixtures.</p>
