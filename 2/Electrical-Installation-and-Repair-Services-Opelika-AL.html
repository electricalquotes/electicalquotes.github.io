Sometimes your transformer will also have a green wire that should be attached to ground‚Äù. This grounding wire neutralizes any dangerous electrical current into the ground. A key smart maintenance tip: Hire in a professional electrician annually to check your electrical systems, just as you would get a checkup for your personal health.</p>

Well lights are light fixtures (that can be low voltage) which can be buried in the ground and lie concealed and up light any surrounding landscape, architecture, and lights create the illusory effect of light spewing from the earth itself. Water conducts electricity, so the fire could actually ignite further. We know that people do business with companies that meet their needs and provide reliable service.</p>
