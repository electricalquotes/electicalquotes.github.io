Alternatively, you can wire the switch up in such a way that only that single outlet will be controlled by the switch, but other outlets in the circuit will still stay powered on constantly.</p>

<p>Cords are not jump ropes, clothes lines or leashes, and should never be used for anything other than their intended purpose. Care must be taken to check all parts of a de-energized circuit because control circuits frequently have cross-connected interlocks that bring power into the controller from another source. It is usually near the point where wires enter the house. Installing an electrical box indoors or outdoors costs the same, about $800 to $4,000, depending on the amperage.</p>
<p>A generator is a back-up electrical system that operates regardless of if you are at home or away. We are fully state certified, licensed, and insured to handle any electrical installation or repair at your home or office.
