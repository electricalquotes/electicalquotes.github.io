<p>When considering an upgrade to your home's electrical wiring, you must take into account the age of your home and the age of the current wiring that is installed. Lights in your home do little good if you can't turn them on, and the power going through your home is useless if your outlets aren't ready and capable to handle appliances. Flickering fluorescent lights, broken light switches, and old wiring are no match for lighting repair professionals.
