So manufacturers just started to dual rate the THHN wire for both so that they didn't have to run two separate wires every time. Egress lighting typically lasts 10 years , as long as the lights used are LED and not incandescent lamps. To make it a half hot you will have to run new wire from the switch to the outlet.

Don't forget that lighting and other electrical circuits for stoves have to be installed by a qualified electrician.</p>
