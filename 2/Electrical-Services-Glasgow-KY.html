<h3>Common Electrical Safety Hazards In Homes And Businesses Glasgow KY 42141</h3>
<p>A circuit breaker trip helps to stop the flow of electricity. A good rule of thumb is that if you upgrade your panel (the electrical service into your house) you should upgrade your wiring. When the main disconnect fuses also need to be changed, along with much of the existing system, this cost can climb even higher. Having a generator on hand lends peace of mind in case of a weather emergency or other power interruption.
