Conditions exist in any transmission and distribution system that result in power losses in the systems and equipment that deliver power and in the systems and equipment that use power.

Be sure to tighten all wire nuts or terminal screws firmly and give each wire a tug test as you connect them.</p>
<p>When you trip” the breaker this refers to the action of your circuit breaker doing the job it was intended to do. If you're constantly tripping breakers then it might be time for an electrical inspection so the reason can be determined and the circuit breakers either replaced or upgraded to better handle the electrical load being placed on them. That's why a recent, first-of-its-kind study from the Fire Protection Research Foundation carefully examined electrical risks and hazards present in older homes.</p>
