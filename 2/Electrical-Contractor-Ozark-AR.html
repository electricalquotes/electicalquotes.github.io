<p>Referring to purpose, intended use or space; typical applications include office lighting, retail lighting, gallery lighting, warehouse lighting, and more. It is strongly recommended that you consult a professional before attempting any lighting or wiring projects.

In addition, everything is already there to run another device, whether an outlet, light or something else, if need be. In the past, too many people have used the ground wire as a neutral, which may work but is not safe.</p>
