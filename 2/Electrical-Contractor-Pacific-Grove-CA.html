If the incoming ground wire from the feed circuit was left long enough, it can be run continuously, connected to a grounding screw that connects the wire to the metal junction box (skip this step if plastic junction boxes are in use), on to the ground screw terminal at each electrical receptacle, and ending with a ground clamp crimp connector that ties the incoming ground to the ground wire of the outgoing wire that continues to the next junction box.</p>
<p>The Standard for Low Voltage Landscape Lighting Systems, UL 1838, covers the safety requirements for landscape lighting systems; the Standard for Low Voltage Lighting Systems, UL 2108, covers incandescent luminaires and luminaire fittings; and the Standard for Low Voltage Lighting Systems for Use in Recreational Vehicles, UL 234, covers luminaires for recreational vehicles.
