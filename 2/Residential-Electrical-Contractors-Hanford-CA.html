<p>Because low voltage lighting systems operate on only 12 volts of electricity, they are completely safe for self installation. When a wire breaks, the electrical spark will arc - or jump - across the gap in order to complete the circuit. When fuses were used, homes didn't require that much electricity. Propane and petrol generators provide a safe, longer fuel supply and are significantly more environment-friendly than gasoline fueled generators. Our outdoor lighting specialists will design and install the landscape lighting that will give you all of the above benefits and make sure that your home remains up-to-code.</p>
<p>Moe, twist on connectors are used to connect the incoming and outgoing hot, neutral, and ground wires, and a single pigtail length in that same twist-on connector can connect the ground to the local junction box.
