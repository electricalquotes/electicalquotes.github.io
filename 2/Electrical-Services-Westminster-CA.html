Home centers carry a limited selection of portable generators (but usually no standby units). Stick with one voltage - 120 volts AC. Also, don't touch electrical equipment, including light switches and power cords, with wet or damp hands. This will be the biggest switch on the electrical panel, and will often be in the form of two switches fused together. For more than a century, Westinghouse has consistently provided innovative, reliable, high-quality products and customer service.</p>

At the outlet box, if there are cables other than the new 3-wire you are using to connect the outlet to the switch, splice them together by color: Black wires together, white wires together, and all ground wires (including the one in the 3-wire cable) together, all with like-colored pigtails. The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules. NRTLs such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Edison Testing Laboratories (ETL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) test appliances to ensure they comply with OSHA's electrical safety rules.</p>
