Electricians will perform a diversity of tasks for both residential and commercial buildings. Factory electricians troubleshoot, install and undertake maintenance tasks on motors, industrial robots, electrical generators and controls on machinery. Most of the time they pick the wrong fuel as they went with diesel, when gasoline would have been better, or chose propane when natural gas was the best choice.</p>
