Surge protection is essential as the overvoltage may damage the lightning protection devices and others across the line. Or, you can substitute an apprenticeship program for 8,000 hours of work experience in an electrical maintenance field for at least 20,000 hours.</p>
<p>A whole house product is more expensive than simple single-outlet surge protectors and often needs professional installation on the incoming electrical power feed; however, they prevent power line spikes from entering the house. Be on the lookout for power lines when using a chainsaw or other outdoor equipment. All surge protectors have a specified response time, this means the period of time in which the surge protector does not stabilise the voltage levels, obviously, the higher the response time then the greater the risk to the appliance in question.</p>
