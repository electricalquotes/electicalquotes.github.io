<p>To properly troubleshoot an electric circuit, you must know how each electrical component in the unit should function and be able to evaluate the performance of each component.

Electricity requires a circuit in order to travel; it will always take the most efficient path. A detailed list of local, pre-screened, Certified Electrical Contractors will be displayed for your choosing. Do not operate any electrical appliance with wet hands or while standing in water.

Limited Electrician - You must have completed an approved electrical study program of at least 576 hours. A surge protector is an electrical device that is used to protect equipment against power surges and voltage spikes while blocking voltage over a safe threshold (approximately 120 V).

<p>Some homes have fuses inside the breaker panel instead of the more modern circuits.
