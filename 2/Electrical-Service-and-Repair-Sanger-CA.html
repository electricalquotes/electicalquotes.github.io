From there, circuits carry all the needed electricity to the appliances, lights, and outlets in your home. An electrical sub panel - also known as a service sub panel or circuit breaker sub panel - is often required to create new space for circuit breakers and to optimize your electrical system.</p>
<p>This involves determining the specific locations of each light and its outdoor power source. This is not to be confused with tinned copper wiring which has a dull silver finish, but this was used in a much earlier time. If your home wiring circuits are not so identified, the time required to make up such a record will be saved many times over as fuse replacements, fixture alterations and other repairs become necessary. Over heated circuits and loose connections are the most common cause of electrical fires.</p>
