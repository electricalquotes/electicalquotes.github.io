Regular maintenance ensures your generator will never fail to operate as issues such as broken parts, electric malfunctions, and wear and tear as a result of age and usage, can be identified and fixed before they become a problem. LED bulbs can last up to 30 years, where standard bulbs need to be replaced every year or so. Furthermore, because LED fixtures are smaller, they allow for lighting designs which previously may have been impossible due to the limitations of standard systems.</p>
<p>If you find that you have one particular circuit that seems to inexplicably shut off, even with no significant electrical load on it, then you may need to replace a faulty breaker.

Licensed electrician requirements also dictate proper insurance coverage - including Worker's Compensation, liability, and property damage.</p>
