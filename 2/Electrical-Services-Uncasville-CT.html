This is because the typical modern family uses more electrical appliances and devices than a family — let's say — 20 to 30 years ago.</p>
<p>The size of an electrical service is established by the ampacity (capacity) of the incoming service wires. To handle increased electrical requirements, it's likely you'll also need to upgrade electrical wiring, especially if your house is more than 40 years old.
