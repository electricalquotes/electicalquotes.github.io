I will be upgrading the electrical panel in my home from 100 to 200 amps.

Single lights may not provide all the lighting you need. Connect all the fixtures and use a graph paper for calculation of the total length of wire that you need, which would be restricted to a maximum of 250W on a length of 12 gauge cable.

<p>Cords are not jump ropes, clothes lines or leashes, and should never be used for anything other than their intended purpose.
