<p>Nearly all household wire is copper, though aluminum is occasionally used. A surge protector or surge suppressor is an appliance or device designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes. If there is you can check to verify that it is hot all the time and that it is on the same circuit (turn the breaker off and see if both it and the red go dead). If you've noticed that the electrical outlets in your home aren't working as well as they use to, or they aren't able to hold the plug, it may be time to repair or replace it. Having malfunctioning outlets can be a serious shock and fire hazard.</p>
<p>Electrical wiring problems can potentially cause serious fire and electrocution hazards, so it's better not to take a chance if there is any question in your mind about safety. Avoid overloading extension cords, sockets and plugs. If you do not have an electrical outlet outside your house, then you will have to pay to have one put in. If the location where you want your low voltage lights is some distance from the outlet, then you will need to purchase additional wiring and bury it. All of this is a hassle that is easily avoided by choosing outdoor solar lights instead of the low voltage garden lights.</p>

<p>This evaluation should include a thorough examination of the existing electrical service, electrical panel and wiring system. Your Breaker is Old - If your breaker box is old and the parts required for breaker repair are no longer available, it may be time to consider an upgrade. So, if a power surge occurs, the device will keep any harmful electrical currents from damaging your home devices. Periodically check casings for damage, and replace any frayed or cracked cords immediately.</p>
<p>Homes today have an estimated $15,000 worth of electronics and may experience up to 100 surges per month that can degrade or damage your electronics, shortening their life.
