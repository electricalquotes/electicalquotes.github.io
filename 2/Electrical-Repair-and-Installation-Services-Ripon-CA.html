<p>Inspect all electrical appliances, such as vacuum cleaners, to ensure they're properly grounded. Every day, all around the world, people depend on technology, transportation, energy and infrastructure to live, work and thrive.

<p>When an outage occurs, the switch is triggered (usually automatically in the case of an automatic transfer switch, but some models require a manual switch flip) and switches from utility power to the generator, which turns on automatically when the switch engages. Since a traditional knob and tube electrical circuit lacks a ground wire, these circuits should be upgraded to new wire whenever possible. An electrician can help make wiring a light switch hassle-free.</p>
<p>And remember, if you're unsure about an electrical outlet or appliance, always ask a professional to take a look and keep you and your family safe. Older wiring was installed with lower amperage in mind compared to the requirements of today's electrical appliances. There are countries that make the use of standards a compulsory thing when one is considering a Surge Protection Device for the big buildings that are very sensitive like data centers, hospitals, and industrial facilities.</p>
