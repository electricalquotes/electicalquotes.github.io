If your home has two-prong outlets, there's no safe way to update them to modern three-prong outlets, short of calling a licensed electrician. You see, solar lighting runs purely off the power it draws from the sun during the day. In many cases, putting in a spa or sauna requires a dedicated electrical circuit, and this should be handled by a licensed professional.
