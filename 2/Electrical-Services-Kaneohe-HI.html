Power from your utility company flows into your home through this panel, where it branches out into major electrical branches, dwindling into smaller branches in order to distribute power. However, there are some differences between installing low voltage outdoor lighting systems and installing light fixtures in your home. GFCIs (ground-fault circuit interrupters) can greatly reduce the risk of shock by immediately shutting off an electrical circuit when that circuit represents a shock hazard (i.e., a person comes in contact with a faulty appliance together with a grounded surface).</p>
<p>It is dangerous to work on an open electrical service panel with both the door and the protective front cover removed. The ceramic is designed to protect the plug (or other equipment inside which the fuse is fitted) from heat and fire when a high current flows. Another reason you may want to upgrade is if you find yourself constantly needing breaker panel repairs. A circuit is comprised of multiple outlets connected to a single wire that is operated by one fuse or circuit breaker.</p>
