If you want your residential or commercial generator to last as long as possible and enjoy an effective working life, preventative maintenance can be a helpful step.</p>
<p>I temporarily screwed in a a couple of metal tabs (cut from scrap - or you can use a small angle bracket) to the wall-plate screw holes (the support bar from a fan outlet box will also work ).

GFCIs (ground-fault circuit interrupters) can greatly reduce the risk of shock by immediately shutting off an electrical circuit when that circuit represents a shock hazard (i.e., a person comes in contact with a faulty appliance together with a grounded surface).</p>
<p>The cost of labor is usually set by the local National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), although non-member electricians are not bound by their hourly wage. A GFCI outlet is an extremely sensitive outlet that monitors the current passing through it. If there's a slight change in current coming back from the equipment plugged into the outlet, the GFCI will automatically disconnect the circuit so the electrical current is no longer flowing.
