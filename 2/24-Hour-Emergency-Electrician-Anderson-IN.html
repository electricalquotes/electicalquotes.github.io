Circuit breakers are contained within your electrical panel and their job is to protect the electrical circuits in your home or building by stopping the flow of electricity in the event of an overload, short-circuit, or other electrical fault.</p>

Licensed electrician requirements also dictate proper insurance coverage - including Worker's Compensation, liability, and property damage.</p>
