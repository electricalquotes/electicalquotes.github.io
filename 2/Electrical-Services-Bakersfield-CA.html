On a commercial installation, an electrician would do a cost savings and payback analysis for the company. When it comes to your electrical system, Bacon is transparent, honest, reliable, and provides you with the customer service you deserve.</p>
<p>Today's homes require up to 200 amps of power or more.

<p>Light bulbs are the single most common electrical fixture in homes, and proper light bulb safety can keep them from becoming a common electrical hazard.
