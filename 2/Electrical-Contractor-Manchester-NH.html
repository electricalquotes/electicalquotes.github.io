<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Manchester</h2>
<p>Electrical contracting is a massive industry valued at more than $130 billion annually. My best advice is to have all the wiring evaluated by a licensed electrician for safety, preferable one that is familiar with aluminum and if you can keep from changing out receptacles, switches and lighting that would be best, just don't mess with it. I know if you are doing a complete rehab, you will want to change out lights, old and dirty light switches and receptacles with many coats of paint, but if you can clean them up, you are better off.</p>
<p>PLEASE turn OFF the power at the fuse box or circuit breaker before you begin installation. If you notice that the switch seems to be reversed i.e. the switch indicates ‘on' but the light is off and if the switch indicates ‘off' but the light is on, then you have incorrectly wired the switch and it will have to be redone properly. This is because the typical modern family uses more electrical appliances and devices than a family — let's say — 20 to 30 years ago.</p>
