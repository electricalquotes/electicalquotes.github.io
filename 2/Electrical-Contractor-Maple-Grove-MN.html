Because all the power to your home is being restored at once, the rush of electricity can cause a surge.</p>
<p>This will help shunt the surge caused by the appliances from the rest of the house, which will help reduce the risk of fire and possibly other electrical meltdowns. Southern Lights can make sure that your landscape lighting always looks spectacular and is checked on an ongoing basis to prevent problems.

We have the experience and expertise to ensure your electrical panel upgrade is completed on time, within budget, and up to code. Each home has its own unique story and reason for professional landscape lighting.
