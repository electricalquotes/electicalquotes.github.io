<p>We have low prices every day on quality lighting along with landscape light installation kits, transformers, posts, rock guards and other parts you'll need.

Lamps provide the light, and a weather-resistant cable transmits electricity from the transformer to the lamps. The top-notch quality and well-built generator will make use of Generac True Power Technology to deliver the best power quality in its class and to ensure smoother and safe operation for your sensitive appliances.</p>
<p>As briefly explained above, the black wires are the power (or hot”) wires and the white wires are the neutral (or return”) wires. Someone turns the lights ON at switch #1. Attach the positive wire from the transformer to the low-voltage light's positive wire and the neutral wire to the the light's neutral with twist-on wire connectors.
