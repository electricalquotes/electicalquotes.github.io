<p>While it is possible that the switched hot wire is available in each box, it is unlikely. Lights can be installed in several different configurations. We offer Design and Electrical Services with latest technology for LV & HV panels, tailor made to suit customer requirements. If you do have to use electricity outside, where it might be wet (like when you're replacing outdoor light bulbs, hanging holiday lights or trimming trees), always wear shoes that have rubber soles, and make sure you only use weatherproof extension cords deemed suitable for outdoor use.</p>
<p>Brint Electric is dedicated to helping those customers in need by providing commercial and industrial emergency electrical service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If there is no neutral wire in the switch box, such as in the diagram at the top of this page, you likely cannot use a smart switch. It's recommended to replace it after a major electrical event (such as when lightning blows out the transformer down your street). The easiest way to determine which type of dimmer you will need is to find out how many switches control your light fixtures.</p>
<p>And remember, if you're unsure about an electrical outlet or appliance, always ask a professional to take a look and keep you and your family safe. Older wiring was installed with lower amperage in mind compared to the requirements of today's electrical appliances. There are countries that make the use of standards a compulsory thing when one is considering a Surge Protection Device for the big buildings that are very sensitive like data centers, hospitals, and industrial facilities.</p>
